    <h2>The Recipe</h2>
        <p>
            I have been smoking ribs for fun for about 15 years now. 
            For me, it's a cathartic experience. 
            One that helps me forget all my ailments

            Smoking ribs is a science.
            It's as simple as nailing down these essential elements:
            temperature, time, salt, and pepper.

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slab of your favorite ribs (I prefer the St. Louis cut)</li>
            <li>Coarse kosher salt (1/4 tsp per pound)</li>
            <li>Fresh, course ground black pepper</li>
            <li>BBQ sauce if you desire (I like to make my own)</li>
        </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat smoker to 225. Oak smoke preferred.</li>
            <li>Rinse ribs in cool water and remove any bone bits leftover from the buthering process. Pat dry.</li>
            <li>Remove the membrane from the under side of the meat.</li>
            <li>Trim the ribs to a nice, even shape. Keep the sizeable bits and smoke with the ribs.They make excellent mid-cook meat snacks to keep morale high.</li>
            <li>Season ribs to your liking.</li>
            <li>Smoke for 4-7 hours, depending on your cut</li>
            <li>Do not wrap your ribs, total waste of time and foil.</li>
            <li>About an hour or two in, slather on the sauce (if desired).</li>
            <li>Cook until ready.</li>
            <li>Enjoy! And don't forget about the meat snacks. If they burn, morale will suffer.</li>
        </ol>
