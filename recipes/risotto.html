    <h2>The Recipe</h2>
        <p>This is my favorite recipe for the doves (or ducks) just aren't flying.</p>
        <p>With this recipe you can stretch a lonesome dove to feed 2-4 people.</p>
    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1-4 doves (teal, quail, duck anything really)</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>2 slices of bacon, diced (although I usually use more)</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped fine</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mushrooms (extremely optional)</li>
            <li>1 sprig fresh thyme or rosemary</li>
            <li>1/4 cup white wine (I typically finish the bottle while stirring the dish)</li>
            <li>4 tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup parmesean cheese, grated</li>

        </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium pot, cover the doves and bay leaf with cold water and bring to a simmer; cook for about 2 hours, or until tender. Remove the doves and strain the stock into another pan. Set this pan over medium heat. When the doves are cool enough to handle, shred all of the meat from them and set aside.</li>
            <li>In another pot, cook the bacon in the olive oil over medium-high heat until it begins to crisp. Add the gizzards, hearts and livers and cook for about 1 minute, stirring often. Add the onion and optional mushrooms and herbs. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Add the rice to the pan and cook for a couple minutes more, stirring and stirring. Deglaze the pan with the white wine and cook until the liquid is almost evaporated. Now, add a large ladle of the reserved dove stock to the pot and cook, stirring, until the liquid is absorbed. Continue to add stock to the rice, a ladle at a time, waiting until the stock is absorbed, until the rice is tender, but not mushy. The rice should have a little bite left to it, and should be very saucy and slightly pourable, not dense. Adjust as necessary with stock. Stir in the butter, cheese and reserved dove meat, then season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve immediately on warm plates.</li>
